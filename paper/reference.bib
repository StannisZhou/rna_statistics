  abstract = "RNA structure formation is hierarchical and, therefore, secondary
              structure, the sum of canonical base-pairs, can generally be
              predicted without knowledge of the three-dimensional structure.
              Secondary structure prediction algorithms evolved from predicting
              a single, lowest free energy structure to their current state
              where statistics can be determined from the thermodynamic
              ensemble. This article reviews the free energy minimization
              technique and the salient revolutions in the dynamic programming
              algorithm methods for secondary structure prediction. Emphasis is
              placed on highlighting the recently developed method, which
              statistically samples structures from the complete Boltzmann
              ensemble.",

               minimization has been the standard for over two decades. Here we
               describe a novel method that forsakes this paradigm for
               predictions based on Boltzmann-weighted structure ensemble. We
               introduce the notion of a centroid structure as a representative
               for a set of structures and describe a procedure for its
               identification. In comparison with the minimum free energy (MFE)
               structure using diverse types of structural RNAs, the centroid
               of the ensemble makes 30.0\% fewer prediction errors as measured
               by the positive predictive value (PPV) with marginally improved
               sensitivity. The Boltzmann ensemble can be separated into a
               small number (3.2 on average) of clusters. Among the centroids
               of these clusters, the ``best cluster centroid'' as determined
               by comparison to the known structure simultaneously improves PPV
               by 46.5\% and sensitivity by 21.7\%. For 58\% of the studied
               sequences for which the MFE structure is outside the cluster
               containing the best centroid, the improvements by the best
               centroid are 62.5\% for PPV and 31.4\% for sensitivity. These
               results suggest that the energy well containing the MFE
               structure under the current incomplete energy model is often
               different from the one for the unavailable complete model that
               presumably contains the unique native structure. Centroids are

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The nearest neighbor model and associated dynamic
              programming algorithms allow for the efficient estimation of the
              RNA secondary structure Boltzmann ensemble. However because a
              given RNA secondary structure only contains a fraction of the
              possible helices that could form from a given sequence, the
              Boltzmann ensemble is multimodal. Several methods exist for
              clustering structures and finding those modes. However less focus
              is given to exploring the underlying reasons for this
              multimodality: the presence of conflicting basepairs. Information
              theory, or more specifically mutual information, provides a
              method to identify those basepairs that are key to the secondary
              structure. RESULTS: To this end we find most informative
              basepairs and visualize the effect of these basepairs on the
              secondary structure. Knowing whether a most informative basepair
              is present tells us not only the status of the particular pair
              but also provides a large amount of information about which other
              pairs are present or not present. We find that a few basepairs
              account for a large amount of the structural uncertainty. The
              identification of these pairs indicates small changes to sequence
              or stability that will have a large effect on structure.
              CONCLUSION: We provide a novel algorithm that uses mutual
              information to identify the key basepairs that lead to a
              multimodal Boltzmann distribution. We then visualize the effect
              of these pairs on the overall Boltzmann ensemble.",

              programs that simulate folding, hybridization, and melting
              pathways for one or two single-stranded nucleic acid sequences.
              The name is derived from ``Unified Nucleic Acid Folding.''
              Folding (secondary structure) prediction for single-stranded RNA
              or DNA combines free energy minimization, partition function
              calculations and stochastic sampling. For melting simulations,
              the package computes entire melting profiles, not just melting
              temperatures. UV absorbance at 260 nm, heat capacity change
              (C(p)), and mole fractions of different molecular species are
              computed as a function of temperature. The package installs and
              runs on all Unix and Linux platforms that we have looked at,
              including Mac OS X. Images of secondary structures,
              hybridizations, and dot plots may be computed using common
              formats. Similarly, a variety of melting profile plots is created
              when appropriate. These latter plots include experimental results
              if they are provided. The package is ``command line'' driven.

              RNAstructure is a software package for RNA secondary structure

              most recent set of nearest neighbor parameters from the Turner
              group. It includes methods for secondary structure prediction
              (using several algorithms), prediction of base pair

              of a structure common to two sequences. This contribution

              predicting secondary structures of RNAs on the basis of posterior
              decoding of the base-pairing probabilities has an advantage with
              respect to prediction accuracy over the conventionally utilized
              minimum free energy methods. However, there is room for
              improvement in the objective functions presented in previous
              studies, which are maximized in the posterior decoding with
              respect to the accuracy measures for secondary structures.
              RESULTS: We propose novel estimators which improve the accuracy
              of secondary structure prediction of RNAs. The proposed
              estimators maximize an objective function which is the weighted
              sum of the expected number of the true positives and that of the
              true negatives of the base pairs. The proposed estimators are
              also improved versions of the ones used in previous works, namely
              CONTRAfold for secondary structure prediction from a single RNA
              sequence and McCaskill-MEA for common secondary structure
              prediction from multiple alignments of RNA sequences. We clarify
              the relations between the proposed estimators and the estimators
              presented in previous works, and theoretically show that the
              previous estimators include additional unnecessary terms in the
              evaluation measures with respect to the accuracy. Furthermore,
              computational experiments confirm the theoretical analysis by
              indicating improvement in the empirical accuracy. The proposed

              prediction",
  author   = "Ding, Ye and Lawrence, Charles E",
  abstract = "An RNA molecule, particularly a long-chain mRNA, may exist as a
              population of structures. Further more, multiple structures have
              been demonstrated to play important functional roles. Thus, a
              representation of the ensemble of probable structures is of
              interest. We present a statistical algorithm to sample rigorously
              and exactly from the Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures.
              The forward step of the algorithm computes the equilibrium
              partition functions of RNA secondary structures with recent
              thermodynamic parameters. Using conditional probabilities
              computed with the partition functions in a recursive sampling
              process, the backward step of the algorithm quickly generates a
              statistically representative sample of structures. With cubic run
              time for the forward step, quadratic run time in the worst case
              for the sampling step, and quadratic storage, the algorithm is
              efficient for broad applicability. We demonstrate that, by
              classifying sampled structures, the algorithm enables a
              statistical delineation and representation of the Boltzmann
              ensemble. Applications of the algorithm show that alternative
              biological structures are revealed through sampling. Statistical
              sampling provides a means to estimate the probability of any
              structural motif, with or without constraints. For example, the
              algorithm enables probability profiling of single-stranded
              regions in RNA secondary structure. Probability profiling for
              specific loop types is also illustrated. By overlaying
              probability profiles, a mutual accessibility plot can be
              displayed for predicting RNA:RNA interactions. Boltzmann
              probability-weighted density of states and free energy
              distributions of sampled structures can be readily computed. We
              show that a sample of moderate size from the ensemble of an
              enormous number of possible structures is sufficient to guarantee
              statistical reproducibility in the estimates of typical sampling
              statistics. Our applications suggest that the sampling algorithm
              may be well suited to prediction of mRNA structure and target
              accessibility. The algorithm is applicable to the rational design
              of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), antisense oligonucleotides,

  abstract = "Abstract This paper considers the following sequence shuffling
              problem: Given a biological sequence (either DNA or protein) s,
              generate a random instance among all the permutations of s that
              exhibit the same frequencies of k-lets (e.g. dinucleotides,
              doublets of amino acids, triplets, etc.). Since certain biases in
              the usage of k-lets are fundamental to biological sequences,
              effective generation of such sequences is essential for the
              evaluation of the results of many sequence analysis tools. This
              paper introduces two sequence shuffling algorithms: A simple
              swapping-based algorithm is shown to generate a near-random
              instance and appears to work well, although its efficiency is
              unproven; a generation algorithm based on Euler tours is proven
              to produce a precisely uniform instance, and hence solve the
              sequence shuffling problem, in time not much more than linear in
              the sequence length.",

              sequences with a small distance between them, can their
              similarity be explained by their base composition alone? The
              nucleotide order of these sequences contributes to their
              similarity if the distance is much smaller than their average
              permutation distance, which is obtained by calculating the

              determine whether their similarity can be explained by their

  abstract = "Goodness-of-fit tests are useful in assessing whether a
              statistical model is consistent with available data. However, the
              usual $\chi$² asymptotics often fail, either because of the
              paucity of the data or because a nonstandard test statistic is of
              interest. In this article, we describe exact goodness-of-fit
              tests for first- and higher order Markov chains, with particular
              attention given to time-reversible ones. The tests are obtained
              by conditioning on the sufficient statistics for the transition
              probabilities and are implemented by simple Monte Carlo sampling
              or by Markov chain Monte Carlo. They apply both to single and to
              multiple sequences and allow a free choice of test statistic.
              Three examples are given. The first concerns multiple sequences
              of dry and wet January days for the years 1948-1983 at Snoqualmie
              Falls, Washington State, and suggests that standard analysis may
              be misleading. The second one is for a four-state DNA sequence
              and lends support to the original conclusion that a second-order
              Markov chain provides an adequate fit to the data. The last one

              sequence analysis to evaluate the statistical significance of a
              biological sequence. In many cases, biologists need sophisticated
              shuffling tools that preserve not only the counts of distinct
              letters but also higher-order statistics such as doublet counts,
              triplet counts, and, in general, k-let counts. RESULTS: We
              present a sequence analysis tool (named uShuffle) for generating
              uniform random permutations of biological sequences (such as
              DNAs, RNAs, and proteins) that preserve the exact k-let counts.
              The uShuffle tool implements the latest variant of the Euler
              algorithm and uses Wilson's algorithm in the crucial step of
              arborescence generation. It is carefully engineered and extremely
              efficient. The uShuffle tool achieves maximum flexibility by
              allowing arbitrary alphabet size and let size. It can be used as
              a command-line program, a web application, or a utility library.
              Source code in C, Java, and C\#, and integration instructions for

               Porschke's zipper model describes the addition of a base pair to
               a nucleated helix in terms of a single type of elementary
               reaction; a concerted process in which the two bases, one from
               each strand, participate in the transition state. In the
               stack-ratchet mechanism proposed here a net base-pairing step
               consists of two elementary reactions. Motions of only one strand
               are required to achieve a given transition state. One elementary
               reaction preorganizes and stacks the 3′ single-strand, driven by
               base−base stacking interactions. A second elementary reaction
               stacks the 5′ strand and pairs it with the preorganized 3′
               strand. In the stack-ratchet mechanism, a variable length 3′
               stack leads the single-strand/double-strand junction. The
               stack-ratchet mechanism is not a two-state process. A base can
               be (i) unstacked and unpaired, (ii) stacked and paired, or (ii)
               stacked and unpaired (only on the 3′ strand). The data suggests
               that helices of DNA and of RNA do not propagate by similar
               mechanisms.",

              and 23S rRNAs, tRNA, RNAse P RNA, and Group I and II introns.
              Initially this method was utilized to fold these sequences into
              their secondary structures. More recently, this method has
              revealed numerous tertiary correlations, elucidating novel RNA
              structural motifs, several of which have been experimentally
              tested and verified, substantiating the general application of
              this approach. As successful as the comparative methods have been
              in elucidating higher-order structure, it is clear that
              additional structure constraints remain to be found. Deciphering
              such constraints requires more sensitive and rigorous protocols,
              in addition to RNA sequence datasets that contain additional
              phylogenetic diversity and an overall increase in the number of
              sequences. Various RNA databases, including the tRNA and rRNA
              sequence datasets, continue to grow in number as well as
              diversity. Described herein is the development of more rigorous
              comparative analysis protocols. Our initial development and
              applications on different RNA datasets have been very
              encouraging. Such analyses on tRNA, 16S and 23S rRNA are
              substantiating previously proposed associations and are now
              beginning to reveal additional constraints on these molecules. A

               neighbor thermodynamic rules. The details of the free energy
               rules and of the latest version 3.0 software are described.
               Future plans are also discussed. The mfold software now runs on
               a variety of Unix platforms; specifically SGI Irix, Sun Solaris,
               Dec alpha Ultrix and on Linux. While the older interactive
               programs of version 2 still exist, they are now run by a variety
               of scripts that make for much easier handling. There is both a
               command line interface for mfold and an HTML interface that runs
               in a Unix environment but can be accessed by anyone with a web
               browser. The thermodynamic basis for the folding model is
               presented in detail, with references given for both specific
               free energy parameters and to overview articles that have
               summarized the state of these nearest neighbor parameters over
               the past dozen years. Both RNA and DNA rules are discussed, with
               some mention of parameters for RNA/DNA hybridization. Although
               the thermodynamic model has grown in complexity to accommodate
               new types of information, the folding algorithm has not yet
               incorporated some features, such as coaxial stacking of adjacent
               helices, and other features will probably remain too difficult
               or computationally expensive to implement. For this reason, a
               new energy calculation program has been introduced to recompute
               the free energies of predicted foldings to reflect the best of
               our knowledge. The most significant improvements in the mfold
               software are: 1. Folding times have been greatly reduced in
               recent years, partly because of faster computers and partly
               because of improvements in the algorithm. 2. Folding constraints
               have been expanded and are now implemented without the use of
               bonus energies that distort the results. 3. The output is
               significantly improved. Clear and enlargeable images of dot
               plots and of predicted foldings are now produced in PostScript
               and gif formats. Bases in structures may be annotated using
               different colors that reflect how well-determined they are in
               terms of their tendency to pair with other bases or to be
               single-stranded. Similarly, base pair probabilities from
               partition function calculations may be used for annotation. A
               detailed decomposition of each predicted folding into stacked
               pairs and loops with associated free energies is now provided.
               The mfold software has a variety of parameters that may be
               adjusted to improve the predictions. Several examples are
               presented to illustrate how to interpret folding results and how
               to adjust these parameters to obtain better results.",
