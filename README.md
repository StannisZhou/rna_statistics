# Introduction

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experimental results in the paper "Base-pair Ambiguity and the Kinetics of RNA Folding".

# Setting up the environment

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/StannisZhou/rna_statistics.git
```

2. Set up the virtual environment
```
cd rna_statistics
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate rna_statistics
```

3. Install the [Vienna RNA package](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/). Make sure `RNAfold` is available at the commandline.

# Reproduce the results

Use
```
python main.py
```
to rerun all the experiments and generate the results. The output of the code would include the files `exploratory_comparative.tex`, `exploratory_mfe.tex`, `bound_unbound.png`, `bound_unbound.tex`, `comparative_mfe.png`, `comparative_mfe.tex`, `formal_analysis.tex` and `data_summary.tex` in the `paper` folder. The manuscript can be regenerated by compiling the `paper.tex` file in the paper folder.
